    A real-time currency converter (<em>works offline too</em>)
</p>

## Synopsis

Select the currencies to convert to and from, enter the amount and the result will be displayed synchronously. The only buttons are to flip the currencies and reset the inputs to their default values

What's so cool about this app is that it works both online and offline. If you're online it will use the fixer API to get the latest forex rates, otherwise it will use the rates since the last time you were online.
